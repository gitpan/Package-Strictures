Revision history for Package-Strictures

1.000000 2014-04-30T12:36:53Z
 [00 Major]
 - A few moderate implementation/dependency changes
 - Packaging changes that might be important for downstreams repackaging by
   hand.

 [01 New Constant generation bug fix]
 - Instead of the previous approach of trying to create constants for the
   per-package stricutres ourselves, we now use a combination of
   constant.pm and Import::Into
 - This approcach should be more reliable long term for ensuring constant
   folding takes place.
 - This change resolves closes #1 on github.
 - This also means this package is no longer broken >perl 5.19.3 after the
   close of perl #79908
 - Thanks to Slaven Rezić for reporting, and thanks to Andreas J. Koenig
   for the scattered smoke testing that helped me find which Perl change
   broke this.

 [02 Moose requirement eliminated]
 - Moose was previously used in Registry.pm to do almost nothing, and so
   the dependency was easy to eliminate.
 - namespace::autoclean was nuked in favour of namespace::clean to further
   eliminate Moose from installation requirements.

 [03 Tooling switched]
 - ExtUtils::MakeMaker is now used instead of Module::Build
 - And "Latest" versions are now only recommended dependencies instead of
   mandatory ones.

 [04 Version Scheme switched]
 - Version scheme reduced to floating point with a mantissa of 6, as
   opposed to a mantissa of 8
 - This is the primary reason for 0.xxx -> 1.xxx
